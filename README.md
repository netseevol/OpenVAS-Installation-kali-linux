# OpenVAS installation from sources for Kali Linux (rolling-release) systems.

This script automates the installation and configuration of OpenVAS (Greenbone Community Edition) from source on Debian 12 systems. It follows the Greenbone Community Edition guidelines to set up a secure and fully functional vulnerability scanning environment, adhering to principles of secure-by-design, least privilege, and defense-in-depth.

## Description

The ``openvas_install.sh`` script installs OpenVAS and its dependencies, configures required system services (Redis, PostgreSQL), and sets up the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) web interface. Key features include:

- Automatic fetching of the latest component versions from GitHub.
- Structured logging with INFO, WARN, and ERROR levels.
- GPG signature verification for source packages.
- Creation of a dedicated ``gvm`` user and group for running services.
- Generation of self-signed SSL certificates for secure web access.
- Configuration of systemd services for OpenVAS components.
- Setup of feed synchronization and PostgreSQL database for vulnerability data.
- Secure permission settings.

## Usage

### 1. Prerequisites:
- A **clean, fully updated Debian 12** system with internet access.
- Root privileges (the script must be run as root).
- At least 1GB of free disk space in ``$HOME/source``, ``$HOME/build``, and ``$HOME/install`` directories.

### 2. Login as root:

```bash
sudo su
```

### 3. Download the Script:

```bash
curl -f -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kastervo/OpenVAS-Installation/master/openvas_install.sh -o openvas_install.sh
```

### 4. Make the Script Executable:

```bash
chmod +x openvas_install.sh
```

### 5. Run the Script:

```bash
./openvas_install.sh
```

### 6. Access the Web Interface:

- After successful execution, the script outputs login details (username: ``admin``, password, and URL).
- Access the OpenVAS web interface at ``https://<host_ip>:9392``.
- For security, change the admin password using:

```
/usr/local/sbin/gvmd --user=admin --new-password=<new_strong_password>
```
*Make sure the TCP port ``9392`` is open on your firewall.*

### 7. Logs:

Installation logs are stored in ``/var/log/openvas_install.log`` for troubleshooting.

***Note:** Replace the self-signed SSL certificate with a trusted one for production environments. Ensure network connectivity to GitHub and Greenbone servers for version checks and feed synchronization.*

## Troubleshooting

Verify the services are running without errors:

```
sudo systemctl status ospd-openvas
sudo systemctl status gsad
sudo systemctl status gvmd
sudo systemctl status openvasd
```

Update the Openvas feeds:
```
/usr/local/bin/greenbone-feed-sync
```

Create a user:
```
/usr/local/sbin/gvmd --create-user=<username>
```

Reset a user password:
```
/usr/local/sbin/gvmd --user=<username> --new-password=<password>
```

Setting the Feed Import Owner:
```
/usr/local/sbin/gvmd --modify-setting 78eceaec-3385-11ea-b237-28d24461215b --value `/usr/local/sbin/gvmd --get-users --verbose | grep admin | awk '{print $2}'`
```
